## Our project

Our project is a kind of Task List (or Todo List).
As it is a minimalist version, it's only working with IDs and descriptions.

## Built with

* Built with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) - A free and open-source IDE

The workspace of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) is included in this repository (even if normally it shouldn't) so that you can load and work on it if you want to change things in order to have your own edition ;)
